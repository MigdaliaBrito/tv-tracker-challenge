# TV Tracker Challenge

Welcome to the TV Tracker Challenge!

This challenge is used to assess your JavaScript coding skills using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [TV Maze API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api).

## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write logic to connect pre-built React components. The final result will be a working TV Tracker application, which fetches TV show data from a third party API, and gives the user the ability to add and remove TV shows to their queue.

## Prerequisites

1. A basic understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
3. Use of the [command line](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) to execute commands
4. Knowledge of React fundamentals
5. Familiar with making web requests using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone _your_ fork to your development machine
3. Install the package dependencies in the project directory by running `npm install`
4. Start the application by running `npm start`
5. This should open your browser at http://localhost:8000/
